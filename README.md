# POS (Part-Of-Speech) Tagging using HMM and RNN

## Introduction
This exercise was completed in preparation for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course at [Tehran University](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in  2020.

In this exercise, we are going to use different methods to determine part-of-speech in the form of sequences. 

### Dataset

The required data is placed in the data folder, in this dataset, there are sentences along with their POS. This collection contains 42 different POS hand can be seen in pos_list.

For RNN, use from Rnn_train.xlsx, Rnn_test.xlsx files for training and test respectively.

For HMM, use from viterbi_train.xlsx, viterbi_test.xlsx files for training and test respectively.

## Model
After implementing each model, evaluation results should be reported. Accuracy, precision, and recall should be calculated.

After implementation, models were evaluated and the results can be seen [here](CA4_report.pdf).
